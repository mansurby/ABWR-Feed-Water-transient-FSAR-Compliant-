# ABWR-Feed-Water-transient-FSAR-Compliant-
This project models the loss of feedwater in an **Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR)** using data from the **Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)**.   The simulation demonstrates how feedwater flow affects reactor stability and safety.

# ABWR Feedwater Simulation (FSAR Compliant)
This project models the loss of feedwater in an **Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR)** using data from the **Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR)**.  
The simulation demonstrates how feedwater flow affects reactor stability and safety.

## Features
- Reactor physics simulation of feedwater loss in ABWR.
- Parameters aligned with FSAR specifications.
- Written in Python with clear, reproducible steps.
- Visualizations of reactor behavior under abnormal conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy / SciPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mansurby/abwr-feedwater-simulation.git
